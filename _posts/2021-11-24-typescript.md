Two and a half years later, I'm leaving the TypeScript team.

It's honestly been a big pleasure, and I have nothing but praise for the team. I feel lucky to have got to work on the
compiler, docs and community infra. I lucked out in that Microsoft was a perfect port to weather the first 2 years of
the pandemic in both [financially](https://www.netcials.com/stock-5-years-nasdaq/MSFT-Microsoft-Corporation/) and as a
stable megacorp which would confidently make it through.

I originally pitched the TypeScript team during interviews that I could help with some of their community scaling and
documentation woes and those are mostly sorted (for a few more years.) For the first year and a half I traded all my
spare-time programming into my TypeScript work and once we were rolling then I could find a bit more life balance.

My largest contribution was the site re-design and documentation rehaul,

A few years ago Danger asked me of I thought I was on the autistic spectrum, my answer of "more than some, less that
most" she felt was a pretty spectrum-y answer. I had considered it for about a decade since a sci-fi book brought up the
idea of [Combat Autism](https://www.karangill.com/glossary-quantum-thief-fractal-prince-jean-le-flambeur/#Combat_autism)
which re-prioritises some thinking patterns.

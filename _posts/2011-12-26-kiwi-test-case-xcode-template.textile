I've been testing my objective-c lately, and I wanted a quicker way to get a test file up and running, there's more glue code needed for objective-c but this at least makes it a bit nicer. I grabbed someone elses XCode template and added some spitshine to make it relevant to me.

Click the above image to download a zip, move it to the folder below, you probably will have to create the Kiwi directory.

<div class="highlight" style="color:white;font-size: 0.8em;">~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/Kiwi/</div>

Thanks to original work from "objvimmer":http://objvimmer.com/blog/2011/10/05/kiwi-xcode-file-template/

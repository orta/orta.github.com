At the end of my 2021 writeup I debated whether these write-ups were sorta just wallowing in negativity, in many ways
the same problems which exist then also exist now, and most continue to get worse. It's definitely an internal debate
for me whether I'm actually creating something of value when I write something which takes 30-60m to read, consumes a
pretty large chunk of it takes emotional energy for someone to read.

An interesting counter-balance in favour of continuing such in-depth write ups appeared by accident late November as I
was idly watching YouTube and discovered an [Aphantasia documentary by WIRED][aphant-wired]. I originally stuck around
for the production values, but quickly realized that me and the protagonist have a _lot_ in common. Aphantasia
effectively means not having an inner minds-eye, e.g. no visual imagination, and it's strongly correlated with
[SDAM][sdam]. SDAM is having a weak auto-biographical memory, but largely being unaffected by that and that definitely
fits with my mental model of _my_ mental model.

Being able to have a comprehensive overview of what I was up to (and generally thinking) has always been a goal of these
write-ups, with the useful side effect of doing it in the public making it easy for others to see where I'm at. If it
accurately reflects my ups and downs, that's just the price I pay for

So, what are the overarching themes for this year?

- Being un-managable
- Aphantasia & me
- Own vs Rent
- Tech's descent into MLMs
- The view from 20k followers
- Understanding how unjust the world is

Then a more traditional overview of what was interesting, and how day to day life is going.

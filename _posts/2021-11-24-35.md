At the end of my 2021 writeup I debated whether these write-ups were sorta just wallowing in negativity, in many ways
the same problems which exist then also exist now, and most continue to get worse. It's definitely an internal debate
for me whether I'm actually creating something of value when I write something which takes 30-60m to read, consumes a
pretty large chunk of it takes emotional energy for someone to read.

An interesting counter-balance in favour of continuing such in-depth write ups appeared by accident late November as I
was idly watching YouTube and discovered an [Aphantasia documentary by WIRED][aphant-wired]. I originally stuck around
for the production values, but quickly realized that me and the protagonist have a _lot_ in common. Aphantasia
effectively means not having an inner minds-eye, e.g. no visual imagination, and it's strongly correlated with
[SDAM][sdam]. SDAM is having a weak auto-biographical memory, but largely being unaffected by that and that definitely
fits with my mental model of _my_ mental model.

Being able to have a comprehensive overview of what I was up to (and generally thinking) has always been a goal of these
write-ups, with the useful side effect of doing it in the public making it easy for others to see where I'm at. If it
accurately reflects my ups and downs, that's worth the energy cost.

The last few years has continued to be incredibly hostile world to concentrate in, and the process of trying to be
empathetic and understanding to the plight of others can often consume so much emotional energy that its hard to do any
creative work at all. In 2021 I could regularly just not have the energy to do any constructive work. I understand that
I am coming from a place where I merely am aware but aren't often directly affected but there's just so much pain out
there and to put your head in the sand and ignoring it doesn't help.

Somewhere mid-way through the year, during a down period, I came out of it via a new foundational philosophy which built
on my existing core of [Optimistic Nihilism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14)
([long](https://durmonski.com/well-being/optimistic-nihilism-explained/)) which is _"Today is the best day to start"_.
It's a somewhat less-optimistic nihilism, not quite 'nihilism' on it's own, maybe if I had to give it a name it's a
pragmatic nihilism.

It's a bleaker interpretation, but we live in pretty bleak times. Since mid-2010s I've seen my enthusiasm for the future
slowly drain away and that kinda sucks because what possible futures does that pessimism obscure?

So, what are the overarching themes for this year?

## Annual Overview

Last year we moved to Ireland, in part so Danger could live closer to family and because America didn't feel like a
great place to live anymore. We really lucked out with our general location in Dublin - right next to three big parks,
which have acted like a [daily nature bath](https://time.com/5259602/japanese-forest-bathing/) for dog walking.

We've not really "seen" Dublin in a sense, Dublin is operating in a lockdown even as I write this but it's starting to
open up and I expect in a few months meetups and conferences might start occurring physically. It's a little hard to
adjust to seeing people again but we've met our neighbours and are trying to get a regular board game night up and
running with them and some dog walking friends too.

### Leaving Microsoft

Last year I talked about having a goal [of financial independence](https://orta.io/on/being/34#2021-themes), I covered a
few ideas: _YouTube_ (kinda worked out, at least I'm shipping semi-regularly), _Education Products_ (didn't work out,
too time expensive and they can only really be targeted at beginners for scale), _GitHub Sponsors_ (still treading
lightly, but it's growing ), _Capture_ (largely failed as a small side-business, but still used by Danger, so worth
maintaining) and _Puzzle Box_.

That goal was in part because I figured it was likely that Puzzle Box might turn into something which needed full time
attention. I can't really talk about it yet, but that ended up the case - some of that was just good luck but another

This year I left Microsoft, to go full time on Puzzle Box. I had intended on trying to take a year out to slow down and
do community open source programming, catch up on some reading and try to decompress. When I balanced that out with the
chance for making something this cool, I figured it was worth a year or two of risk.

There's no Microsoft horror story, I loved working on TypeScript and I enjoyed working with everyone on the team. It's
hard working at that scale, and with so transparency. You end up being having to be extremely conservative in how you
talk in issues/public because there's rarely absolutes and any question ends up being a 'yeah, maybe but' when you have
that many users and such strong backwards compatibility goals.

I can't praise my manager, or the team enough - everyone I worked with on a daily basis always took a long-term
perspective on problems and are genuinely trying to show reverence to the position the product's growth has put them in.
The larger bureaucratic aspects of Microsoft understand the value of TypeScript's independence and put in the time and
staffing to work along-side the compiler team in a way which I think shows smart foresight. I could have stayed and
comfortably grown in many possible directions inside Microsoft's developer division.

I don't think it's quite fair then to put me in
[the 2021 great resignation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Resignation) pile, Microsoft did and
[does](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/05/microsoft-workers-question-mspac-donations-to-trump-supporting-senators.html)
[things](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/18/22940517/windows-11-pro-require-microsoft-account-internet-connection) it
[should](https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/web-browsers/microsoft-edge/259781/users-pushback-against-bloatware-in-microsoft-edge)
not be proud of, but when contrasted to the other tech giants it's always perceived as 'not as bad'. All of them are
unhealthily big and should be split up.

### My Own Radicalization

I can feel myself thinking in more radical and absolutist terms in the last year. I think a part of that is an outgrowth
of being in a more divisive information environment. I find myself regularly reflecting on how much
[shared values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7VaXlMvAvk) I have with folks on the "opposite" sides of spectrum and
yet they come out with such different results.

This year, I devoted a large chunk of my reading time to the books to trying to get a longer perspective on modern
political struggle and economics:

- Capital in the Twenty-First Century
- [Capital and Ideology](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/19/capital-and-ideology-by-thomas-piketty-review-if-inequality-is-illegitimate-why-not-reduce-it)
- Time for Socialism: Dispatches from a World on Fire, 2016-2021
- 21 Lessons for the 21st Century
- A Colony in a Nation
- Fully Automated Luxury Communism
- The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory and the Birth of the People's Economy
- Freedom Is a Constant Struggle: Ferguson, Palestine, and the Foundations of a Movement

With "Capital and Ideology" taking up the majority of that time, and warranting a re-reading in the same year for being
so thorough and complex. I now largely tend to perceive events through a class-based lens of an wealthy political class
and everyone else.

During university in 2005, I was introduced to the mac as a viable option for someone interested in programming as a
career. Somone pitched it to me as a beautiful and well thought-out OS, with UNIX under the hood.

At the time, I was using Linux for school work, and Windows for games. I persuaded my parents that I could get
university work done on an [iBook G4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook) and over time became enamoured by the idea of
being a Mac indie developer.

2006 saw the start of the [Delicious Generation](https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2006/11/06/) - a resurgence of new
developers pushing the design aesthetics of the Mac, and exploring different ways of
[engaging the Mac users community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacHeist). Whilst I wasn't quite focused enough to be
able to contribute apps, that time period left a mark on me. In 2007, I got a
[student scholarship for WWDC](https://twitter.com/orta/status/36295382?s=20) and managed to at least get a sense that
being a Mac indie was something I could potentially have my career as. It took until 2011 before I started working on indie Mac
apps, and that didn't last too long due to VISA issues.

I didn't really put my energy into being a Mac indie developer either full-time nor in my spare time. Once I became
confident enough in my programming skills to do serious work on the Mac, the open source community tools community was
really where my heart lay. I discovered I was a tool builder, not strictly a product one.

I never got a job with a focus on the Mac again.

It's somewhat nebulous, but during the announcements of Apple's new macOS 11 this year, I felt like a line had been
crossed in my mind: The Mac isn't really the right OS for me anymore.

I'm not bitter, things have just changed since I first made the decision to move to the Mac. My priorities have changed, and
so have Apple's. That's OK.

### The Mac is for iOS Users

I think it's great that people who use iOS can re-use their apps now and access them as first-class citizens. I think it's
great for them that the user interface of the Mac has been re-designed to be more in line with iOS. People with iPhones
are the majority here, and the Mac is a getting closer to being a rounding error in Apple's financial reports (it's a 8%
of all Apple profit, and not really growing.)

The Mac reaps benefits of all sorts from the halo effect of iOS's stunning growth (more engineers, more eyes on the
platform, shared tooling). It's also the only platform for making iOS apps, and Apple cares about it.

The bit that's tricky for me is that I don't use a phone, and I want my computer to be more like a truck than a car.

I don't find a phone to be a useful device for me. When I'm not at a computer I don't want to be instantly available to
others, nor do I use a phone as a media consuming device. It's hard enough to find a life balance with my code
contributions without another place to hear pings from.

That means that roughly the last 5 years of Mac changes have passed me by. Desktop OSes are mature, and so Apple has
prioritised a lot of porting iOS features, APIs and building syncing systems. Again, lots of cool stuff, but not pushing
the Mac, it's pushing the consumer device ecosystem.

### Progressively more restricted computing

It's unlikely Apple will ever truly force an App Store only system on the Mac. However, that doesn't mean that the
incentives aren't there for apple both financially (because Apple gets a 15-30% cut of all transactions) or from a
security perspective (Mac apps have a stricter sandbox and can be trusted more by users.)

Inside Apple, I bet keeping the Mac a good general purpose computer is a constant uphill battle.

I must stress, for nearly every Mac user these are good things. They don't want a fully general purpose computer. For
most folks a web browser, a useful file-system and their own edge-case purpose apps provide all they need.

The move towards a more app-store focused, sandboxed OS means that whole genres of apps aren't possible anymore. I'm particularly sad about what happened to Safari extensions over the last few years. I don't want to put my time into a platform where the people starting today have a smaller domain than I did when I started.

### Native is less valuable

The last decade of focus on mobile by everyone has drastically reduced the value of writing a native app for a single
platform. The Mac has kinda been hit the hardest by this in my opinion. Mac software used to be about HIG conformance,
consistent design and interaction models - all of which tended to come at a pretty expensive price.

The Mac software ecosystem was like a street of local shops run by people in the community, and then post-iPhone
all the big shops moved in because they just wanted to make sure they were represented in the area. Modern desktop
environments now feel quite same-y, but this also trivialized OS switching costs.

The rise of Electron being the most _accessible_ developer environment for desktop OSes has meant that all sorts of apps
are available on all platforms. They're performant enough, and far more importantly _they actually exist_. You have to
have a lot of resources to ship a Website, Windows App, Mac App, iOS App and Android app just to somewhat be where your
users are.

Unless your company builds an app for just one platform, it's just not worth the engineering
investment to make something work amazingly for each platform. In part that's the initial cost, but the maintenance is
also a long term pain because OSes do re-designs or change the underlying tech. At Artsy we used to think it'd be
roughly 1 month per year in just keeping up with iOS updates, imagine that but also per platform and you're struggling to
even stand still.

Using something like Electron, and to some extent React Native, and you get to skip a lot of the OS update rat-race and
just work on a stable platform that runs across many OSes. Any engineer can create a feature that works across all
platforms. On top of that you get to use the world's most popular programming language (JS) and UI toolset (HTML/CSS) to
make your apps.

These incentives means a lot of the apps I use today are all cross-platform Electron apps: VS Code,
Slack/Discord/Matrix, Spotify, Keybase/Signal

As the Mac software market gets harder to make money in, a few of the native apps I used have also moved to be
subscription services. This is in large part due to the app store de-valuing software (can't pay for software updates,
you realistically have to keep providing updates for OS changes, trial system barely exists, people have lower
price-point expectations due to iOS' scale) but sometimes due to these apps wanting to build and provide syncing systems
to account for mobile devices.

I'm all for paying money for applications, I especially like "pay for x months of updates" but generally subscriptions
are a trap to me. Which has meant independently of switching platforms, I've moved off more native software over the
last few years.

I do think there's still a space for optimized native single platform software on the desktop (Sketch, Paw, Pixen, Nova
and Screenflow being great examples) but they are progressively becoming more and more niche.

Apple knows this, and the Mac has slowly become a better platform for time-cheap iOS ports in the last 2 releases.

### The answer is elementary

So 2020 became the start of my migration to Linux. Notably, [elementary OS](https://elementary.io).

In a way, elementary OS is like using an older build of macOS
([elementary OS 5](https://blog.elementary.io/introducing-elementary-os-5-1-hera/) feels a lot like macOS Snow Leopard,
with [6's feature-set](https://blog.elementary.io/updates-for-july-2020/) echoing macOS Lion). This might sound like a
insult to elementary, but honestly I can't remember what's new in the Mac anymore because I don't really use the new
features. 

There's quite a lot of modern features you may be used to that aren't on elementary OS, but the features that make you
productive as an engineer are. There's a great terminal, web browser, file manager and your key IDE apps are likely
cross-platform by this point. Keyboard shortcuts work solidly. Almost all of my hardware worked out of the box.

I've not done a hard switch, probably never will, my laptop still runs macOS and I have a Mac Pro still around - there's
no need to junk them, but I'm competent in using Linux as my daily driver.

I think moving to an OS which I can contribute to, and especially elementary OS which is _mainly_ contributed to by a
few individuals using the same toolchain, is something I can do now. I'm really interested in diving more into the OS,
all of the apps seem to be built in a straightforward way and I've found a way to write native GTK applications with
TypeScript to scratch my own itches. Hopefully the write-up next year will include a discussion on how that's gone.

### Migration Pattern

Roughly my route to switching first was about making long-term changes to my Mac usage:

- Move to electron apps, or cross platform alternatives. For example I switched from 1Password to Enpass, Sketch to
  Figma, Apple Music to Spotify, Apple TV to Netflix, Safari to Firefox etc.
- Switch to a non-Apple keyboard/mouse. The non-native feel of Apple products on other OSes will give you constant
  uncanny valley. I use a Logitech "MX Keys" keyboard, and "MX Vertical" mouse and they're great. If you're bold you
  could try a split keyboard.
- Think about what OS you want. IMO in Linux there are three options for newbies I would recommend: Ubuntu (easiest,
  most likely for anything to work), elementary OS (simplest, most consistently designed) and pop_OS (it's loved and
  considered a 'programmers' linux distro)

I bought a new computer for it, as it was a good excuse to get a machine which runs the TypeScript test suite in a
reasonable timeframe, but anything other than the newest M1 Macs can run all these OSes. Once you've got one
dual-booting, or on a fresh computer:

- Set up proprietary drivers (graphics cards, MP4 playback etc)
- Expect a learning curve, and take it slowly
- Don't take it too seriously, switch back when you need to and get comfortable rather than going head first and making
  a hard switch

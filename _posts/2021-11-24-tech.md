What's left of my optimism likes to imagine 2021 is a part of a dying breath of hyper-capitalism, the pragmatic in me
looks at the rise of "web3" as a more persistent set of technical grifters who will be sticking around to continually
piss in the watering hole of tech culture.

If you need to catch up on the state of damage of the crypto, here's some starters:

- https://web3isgoinggreat.com (cultural)
- https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/ (ecological)
- https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog/against-crypto.html (technical)
- https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/opinion/crypto-cryptocurrency-money-conspiracy.html (political)

If you work in the crypto space, you should really be reconsidering your impact on the world and whether your continued
work is having a positive impact on our collective culture, ecology and technical sphere. In many ways it's even a
little disappointing to see [NFTs on Artsy](https://nft.artsy.net/auctions/22-for-2022), but it's too big to ignore in
the art world because while NFTs are mostly grifters self-selling or stealing artwork, artists already on Artsy also
want to get paid somehow.

That said, my sympathies for companies like Square n√©e [Block](https://www.block.xyz),
[Kickstarter](https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22825086/kickstarter-crowdfunding-blockchain-open-source-protocol-cleo)
and to [some extent Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/nft) where you could have been doing culturally useful work and
then have the company just move set sail in a bad wrong direction and you have no call in the matter.

While [Jesse Squires says][https://twitter.com/jesse_squires/status/1496555140576337926] far harsher than I, but I
largely agree. I think the last 5 years of 1Password is a good metaphor of what's happening at scale for the industry:

- 1Password, built a solid, business making a great native Mac app, universally loved
- ~10 years later, takes VC money
- Starts subscription service
- Removes local storage of passwords
- Re-writes apps in electron
- Starts dabbling in crypto

The thing to consider though, 1Password's downfall is not a plain and simple case of 'corporate greed' to me. I think
1Password were/are facing an existential threat from Apple as they were getting sherlocked by Apple at an OS level and
had on real recourse at staying as 'a great native app' because 1Password relied on Apple for APIs which would always be
second class to the APIs Apple used.

On the Mac this was OK because there was application interop, but the limited, sandboxed, webkit-only world of iOS meant
that 1Password would always be a worse experience than using the built-in password systems.

To me, 1Password acts as an example of both how hard it is to exist in a market defined by rent-seeking tech giants and
how difficult balancing building a sustainable tech business is when you are aiming for quality. At some point,
1Password's leadership team had to say to themselves we've got to change the company focus by taking VC cash or we have
to start losing staff.

I moved away from almost all of the industry giants - but it's not an easy task, and I also made most of the move while
concurrently working for one of the biggest corporation in the world. But this is now largely complete:

- Google: I stopped using gmail as my primary email, and now periodically check it 2-3 times a week. I have an android
  phone (because you can't _really_ not have a phone at all) but I'd like to get linux on it some time. I still use
  YouTube a lot and would debate paying ~5 euros to remove ads from it.

- Apple: It got hard to use Linux in Microsoft after
  [SolarWinds](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/13/microsoft-discovers-threat-actor-targeting-solarwinds-serv-u-software-with-0-day-exploit/)
  which meant I was still using my Mac Pro for a lot of work work. However, post Microsoft I've not turned it back on. I
  bought a [Starbook](https://ie.starlabs.systems/pages/starbook) to replace my MacBook Pro and it's been _OK_. (My 2019
  MBP is the worst MacBook I've owned though, trigging duplicate keypresses and an unpredictable battery which
  arbitrarily turns off.) I don't miss Apple ecosystem, but I do miss the craft from smaller indie apps.

- Amazon: I stopped my (10 year) Audible subscription, stopped using amazon for shopping this year. I've haven't built
  any web infra with AWS in a few years. I still use S3 as my main web storage medium due to inertia.

I also dropped [Spotify](http://orta.io/notes/apps/migrating-from-spotify) this year, and moved to SoundCloud (though
Bandcamp is still a possibility). For almost all of these choices, the user experience in SoundCloud makes no sense to
me but I'd happily take a few productivity hits and snags for feeling like the people I'm supporting are doing good.

Extracting myself from these has left me with a much simpler setup ( I use [pop_OS](https://pop.system76.com) nowadays
after it looked like elementary
[wasn't on solid grounds](https://www.webpronews.com/elementary-os-founders-split-putting-project-in-question/) anymore
) without a lot of bells or whistles, but its a simpler system which I trust to be on my side. I think of these as all
smaller individual choices which are generally a bit too much for others to ensure, and am largely looking forwards to
anti-trust / systemic improvements at attacking monopolies. I'm not optimistic though.

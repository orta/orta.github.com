I've always been a fan of the Seinfeld calendar approach to doing difficult things. For him, every day you write a joke, kinda doesn't matter how good it is but you get to mark it off and you keep on keeping on. Writing up every year was like that, _until I needed to pause it_, now coming back out of this privacy hole it's going to be a bit of a stretch to find what this document is and how to write it.

I used to make 5 year plans, some of my first ever plans were _'work at Apple'_, _'do a TED talk'_ and be able to _'cover "I will follow you into the dark"'_, solo somehow. Something I learned from these plans was that by the time I had hit the middle of 5 years, I was not the same person. The goals and my wants had shifted so much that none of those targets felt right anymore.

How far away am *I* from the man who last wrote _'on being 34'_ at the end of 2020, locked in his apartment in Brooklyn in the midst of COVID when it was peak dystopia?

I opened that write-up with the statement:

> _How does anyone strive in an environment like this?_

Good question, I managed it, but I'd trade it all for a better world.

### The Missing Years

I stopped writing these posts because Zach Gage and I decided to take "Puzzle Box" seriously, and that required a new level of focus and secrecy around my work which is novel. Well, that and that they were getting progressively darker. I think a lot of us were going though some serious shit in 2020 and 2021. Here in the ends of 2025, we're just _used_ to the 2020's and what that means. Then... it was more raw.

To put one word in front of another, lets explore a the highest level changes since 2020:

- I co-founded, built and sold a tech company
- We lived an entire live in Dublin, and now live in London
- I discovered I had Aphantasia
- My ability to contribute and maintain the level of OSS dropped considerably
- Twitter died a death
- I introduced a new foundational philosophy, and changed my favourite movie
- I have taken gardening and understanding plant care very seriously
- I enjoy player-vs-player video games
- Danger & I made it through the 7 year itch

and then, lets try talk through the year 2025.

### Puzzle Box -> Puzmo -> Puzzmo

At the end of 'on being 34' I was still working at Microsoft on TypeScript, I would have been starting to see the end in sight though. I proposed a bunch of work to the TypeScript team during interviewing, and I was coming to the end of it. That left me with an option to either go deep on being a compiler engineer, or explore other teams / projects. I loved working on the team, and I have only the highest praise for everyone making TypeScript happen. It may turn out to be one of the most impactful roles I ever have. But, I was coming to the end of being super useful though, and was just moving towards being pretty useful. I'm a breadth engineer, and for a compiler project being deep is better.

Zach had proposed to me an idea with a reasonable scope for "puzzle box" which was maybe I could work on while still working on TypeScript, and for a while this felt possible. The partner we were exploring working with changed that plan, and it felt like the only way to do this was to do it all ourselves. With that, we started to explore fund-raising for Puzmo.

We hit a few dead-ends, and then absolutely lucked out by finding Astra - a non-profit dedicated to helping get more puzzle games into the world. We pitched a bigger investment than they'd ever done before and worked through making it happen. For a while, Astra acted somewhat close to a publisher for Puzmo. We reported to them pretty regularly, and for the first year of development Puzmo had a reasonable scope and I found some balance in working through the tail-end of the pandemic lockdowns and chilling out.

I really do mean mean chilling out though, the first year of working on Puzmo in Dublin (2022) is possibly the calmest period I've had in a decade or so. I couldn't do open source, I didn't have meetups/conferences, I didn't have things to write on Twitter and so it gave a lot of time for long walks in the park, tending to houseplants, learned to Skateboard. rock-climb, read much more books than normal and tried expanding my video game horizons.

This all changed when Wordle got big.

Wordle obviously changed the _"puzzle games on the web"_ space, converting it from a relatively niche space to something everyone has heard of and a lot of folks were very interested in building a games platform.

To me, this was sort of the switch from Puzmo to Puzzmo. We had this choice: do we ship right now while Wordle culture is growing, or do we burn hard and aim to build something which acts a bit like the 'next generation' of these games. We opted for the latter, and in the process, I gave up on side-projects and Open Source. For the rest of that year, I drastically reduced time for anything which was not writing code and working on Puzzmo. I've only allowed one side-project since then.

Zach does a great job explaining some of our motivations for selling Puzzmo in this Puzzmo newsletter, but in rough: to make Puzzmo long-term successful we needed to be sure that there was a working business attached to Puzzmo the product. We couldn't just "develop/design it" and assume that we'd be able to figure out a business-side as we go along, as we were selling subscriptions and you really need a long-term business rather than some product people making something and moving on.

We didn't predict that we'd be selling Puzzmo before it became live, I remember being out in Australia for a friends wedding for three weeks as multiple offers started coming in, and I just kept ended up stuck in these brain loops - it's not exactly like winning a lottery, but the scope of potential change is wild. The breadth of _"how does this affect X"_ was tricky to articulate and understand ahead of time. My poor wife just had to deal with these small shell-shocks.

The money isn't fuck you money, but its enough that I could start a system of direct donations in a way that echos one of the most pivotal moments in my life. If you meet me IRL, I'll tell you about it.

### Dublin -> London

Dublin is a cool city. I was still not happy with the feeling of displacement when living in Brooklyn, and Danger kinda like she wanted to live a bit closer to her family. Microsoft, like all Big Tech companies, had a HQ in Ireland and so the transition to Ireland could be helped via the company, which was a net win.

We settled in Kilmainham, it was across the road from a big park and we found ourselves part of pretty tight-knit community. We got to know our neighbours and fellow locals in a way that's hard to do in a big city. 

I liked to tell people I lived 0 miles from the Guinness factory, so it's as good as you can get!

I had hoped there would be a tech scene in Dublin, but it was too early post-lockdowns for that all to really happen. Ironically the only time I got COVID was when I ran my own meetup, which put the brakes on giving that another shot.

So, instead we took to being dog-walker people and for the Puzmo period: I learned how to Skateboard by using it for short-term transport, and took it to the park often. I bought an annual pass for a local bouldering gym and learned to rock climb to a pretty good level.

We visited Northern Ireland a lot, (where Danger is from), and the north visited us a lot.

We opened our house to some Ukrainians for a few months, they ended up working for the Irish government helping more Ukrainians integrate into Ireland.

Danger got a little overboard with dog fostering, but it makes for some fun stories and our dog Hayes loved moving from The Big City to a smaller quieter locale.

I ended up on two documentaries while in Dublin, one for Svelte and another for TypeScript.

After the acquisition, I was starting to wonder what it might look like to come out of my Puzzmo fugue and thought that I'd really like to get back some of the things I loved about New York. I pitched that maybe London could be a place for Danger to hang out with her workmates IRL and that I'd be able to find a programming community with people that can challenge/push me.

#### London

We have been living in London for about a year and a half now, and it's nice. I think we've both changed so much though that it's hard for us to really engage with the city like we used to.

In Manhattan, pre-pandemic, we may not have had space but we had time and energy to be doing stuff. Now, I'm so busy all the time that we're just not really taking advantage of the stuff the city provides. I come with my own looser internet friends from Open Source, but the folks Danger knew moved out within a year of us arriving leaving.

This makes committing to London much less of an enticing offer, so we're probably going to be moving up north. Assuming this gets out, and assuming I am doing another next year - that one may be about finding/having found a place up north and settling in.

### Aphant life

I think my drive is abnormally high, and while that never really bothered me - I've never really had a satisfying explanation. I don't consider myself particularly ambitious, but my devotion to craft and time commitment to programming is an outlier. For many years in a two period, I was in the top 20 most active contributors on GitHub, that's not normal.

Well, I wasn't looking for one, but one day I absently put on a WIRED documentary in the background about someone who couldn't visualize images in their head and I ended up finding one.

In rough, most people have the ability to visualize an apple in their hand if they want to, or can remember accurate sounds, smells, tastes etc. This doesn't happen to me. This has a few side effects:

- My memories don't come with attached images/sounds/smells/emotions, it's just kinda facts.
- I don't really have much of an auto-biographical memory, which could be why I started doing these write-ups in the first place
- There's links to autism, but I think for me it's a pretty weak connection

This last one was interesting, as I've used a term from a book for a long time "Combat autism" as a way to try describe how it feels to be exist in my body. When I compare how it feels Danger there's a lot of behavioral things which come naturally for her which I have to learn and study to internalize.

<!-- link to combat autism -->

Aphantasia kinda neatly takes a bunch of "this is a bit odd" and wraps it into a single neat "your brain doesn't connect things the way most folk do" which felt cool to discover and simplified a lot of internal questions.

### Losing my religion

I just don't have time for the breadth of community contributions I used to. Am I bummed about it? Yep. I met so many interesting people, and found a way to connect to so many people who had similar values but different interests.

_"Wanting to do more OSS"_ is a lot like _"I'll do the gym next year"_, it's trivial to say, and for most engineers it probably is something they would like to actually do. Committing the time and actually doing it though it much harder.

For me, not contributing to Open Source on a daily basis has felt like a pretty big loss - I made a lot of great friends working in GitHub and talking about our work at conferences. It was (and I'd like it to still be) a part of my identity, it's like a mixture of volunteering, hanging out and mastering my craft all in one activity.

It's hard from two angles:

- I can't Open Source Puzzmo in the ways that made sense at Artsy
- Due to the sale of Puzzmo, my incentives are heavily aligned to simply _"Get Puzzmo successful"_ which means doing non-Puzzmo stuff (like writing this post) feels like I'm not focusing on my core goals

I've never been this busy, for this long, with barely any downtime. Leadership level of Puzzmo is a lot more time-consuming than _technical_ leadership was at Artsy.

That leaves little time to related-but-not contributions to collective efforts.

### Linux on the Desktop

I've grown very tired of big-tech computing. Their constant need to grow has forced a very large amount of needless change and entropy into the everyday tools I use.

So, at the start of this 5 year gap, while working at one of the megacorps, I started a full-scale migration to using Linux every day. At first this was difficult, but over time it got easy.

Then, early this year, I agreed to make an iPhone app for Puzzmo and had to re-engage with the macOS ecosystem. Its great hardware, but it feels more and more like a consuming device as shared code from iOS squeezes the platform into a smaller and smaller design space.

Working with Linux every day has been super gratifying though, the platform is stable, the tools for making Puzzmo work great - I could choose my own hardware, put it all together and make a really cool desktop. I've been using [Pop_OS!](https://system76.com/pop/) which has a focus on keyboard and workspace mechanics. Pop_OS! has lots of really nice touches which feels like it's being used every day by folks who care, and it's based on Ubuntu which means it has a solid compatibility layer

I've yet to find a Linux laptop I enjoy using though, so that space is currently taken by the Mac I need for building iOS apps.

### Un-social Media

I'm barely a lurker on any social media platforms now. I had such a great time on Twitter from 2012 till 2020, it truly felt like a place to be able to hang out and chat with interesting folks.

I think a large part of this was due to the fact that I could use Tweetbot to access Twitter in a non-algorithmic way, where I had rich filtering tools and a small product surface. When the plug was pulled on Tweetbot - it became obvious that the Twitter I used was nothing like the Twitter they wanted me to use.

There's enough posts on the internet talking through the downfall of the platform, but this all happened to me during a period of not being able to talk about my work.

During the 'Puzmo' period, Zach and I simply disappeared off these networks and were just heads down. Coming back, it doesn't feel as valuable as it once did. Most posts, on all platforms, often look like engagement baiting and not a good use of time.

Nowadays, I don't use a mobile phone, don't use native apps for social networks and then only really check bluesky every day or two. I mainly use it to search for "puzzmo" to test the water of folks using it, and to try and leave nice comments to people who I met back in my Open Source days.

### Do it Today

Like everyone in the 2020s, I went through a few slumps. It's not right to call it a depression, the way folks who have that describe a depression seems so much more intense. But, they are like periods where everything just feels a bit weightless and un-inspiring. These can last weeks to months, and are generally something I can either distract myself through or think myself out of.

My most recent slump I ended by coming to a pretty dark, but I think defensible theory of that is _'Things structurally are getting worse, and will probably continue to get worse. So, the best time to do something is right now.'_

It's been a few years now, and this one just continues to pay out. It offers a reason for agency, provides a way to empathise with others and fits really well with some of my other tenets like Optimistic Nihilism (roughly: _if nothing matters, and you can only have a subjective experience of the world, then you get to choose your own definitions of what matters_) or Work In Public (_always default to most the public way to interact_)

### The Seven Year Itch

Danger introduced me to the idea that there's a trope of people hitting 7 years in their relationship and things being rocky - I'm a believer in the concept that people change often in their lives, and at a pretty regular interval. Perhaps this is when folks start seeing two sets of personal changes where you're less compatible? 

Danger and I have been doing great. It's wild that you can go back and read ["On Being 25" (2012)](/on/being/25) and see us starting to date, and now we're a really settled-in married couple who still pushes each other to try new things, and acts as a core emotional support structure.

We've lived in a few countries, made a bunch of friend groups together and its been really gratifying to see her also flesh out into a complex adult. Just before the lockdown era we had been exploring psychedelics together, and lately we've been going through a party drugs era.

Which is nice, doing these things as an adult means you get to really examine the difference between your default state and embrace the change while it is happening.

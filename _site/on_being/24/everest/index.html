<h3>on being 24 &#8211; part 1</h3>
<p>I had my 24th birthday on Everest, I try to accept every invitation that gets offered my way, as this seems to be a pretty good way to ensure I&#8217;m leading a nice life. I&#8217;d done hints of long walks before but never really anything greater than 2-3 hours. So when my mum said she and her friends were training to do basecamp everest, I took up the offer to walk with her as often as I could to keep her on track. Cut forwards a few months and my mum realises that she has serious work issues around November time, which is when she&#8217;s going and will probably have to cancel. Kinda sucked, she&#8217;d put a lot of good training into that. So she asked me to go in her steed. And I said sure.</p>

<p>Now, as with going and living in brazil, I never quite thought this through until I was pretty much there. But my logic was that I was already pretty healthy, and I knew I could run practically forever, so walking shouldn&#8217;t be too bad. As it turned out it wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I got out of the country and into kathmandu, Nepal, a nice city, very similar to india&#8217;s larger cities. There we could grab anything that we didn&#8217;t need, and the street markets were full of both amazing food and imitation hiking gear.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t need anymore gear, I&#8217;d taken all of my mum&#8217;s. =)</p>
<p>Getting up onto the mountain range itself involves flying up to what could possibly the craziest airport of all time, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenzing-Hillary_Airport">Tenzing-Hillary Airport</a>, Lukla. This airport is tiny, with a sloped runway and the weather that can easily ruin your day. Our guide said that he leaves 2-3 days buffer around flying up because it&#8217;s that unpredictable. Oh and wikipedia says that it&#8217;s the most dangerous airport in the world.</p>
<p>The airport takes you to this little village with it&#8217;s own faux starbucks, on the way down I grabbed a mug from this place, still use that now. Also, this is probably the cheapest place to buy a mars bar from here on in, at roughly £1.</p>

<p>Now, when writing about long periods of walking, there&#8217;s not really much to write about, I learnt this reading Stephen King&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Walk">The Long Walk</a> (which is brilliant and everyone should read.) We would walk for about 8 to ten hours everyday, and at a nice leisurely pace so we could stop off and rest, I spent a lot of time just kicking back and walking on my own debating things like girls, my plans and my band. I found some important answers up there.</p>
<p>There were lots of interesting distractions on the route: like mapping the cost of mars bars up the mountain (prices deviated but pretty much maxed out at £5 at base camp. I figured I&#8217;d get one because there was no way I could find another way to pay so much again.) to eating yak&#8217;s cheese pizza (I spent the night throwing up)</p>

<h3>But here&#8217;s the answer to a few niggling questions you might have.</h3>
<p><strong>Did I have to camp out?</strong> No, though had we gone any further than basecamp, yes. Throughout the walk we would walk through small villages that usually had a single hotel. So we could camp out there.<br />
<strong>Where did I get the Mars Bars?</strong> Lots of people would convert the front of their house (at least the ones going out onto the &#8216;main road&#8217;) to mini shop fronts selling some chocolate, water, occasionally fruit and toiletries. <br />
<strong>How did they get all this stuff?</strong> From the moment you get to Lukla Airport there are no cars. Everything is carried on the back&#8217;s of mainly old men and women, or Yaks. So it was common to let men with boxes meters high walk past you on these routes. Oh yeah, there&#8217;s only one road too more or less. Except when it splits, and as everyone is a bhuddist, you always have to go round everything clockwise.<br />
<strong>Interwebs?</strong> Yep, at least every 2-3 days we&#8217;d stop somewhere with an internet cafe, how else could I Facebook propose to my current wife <a href="http://twitter.com/_whatshesays">Raîssa</a>, or just throw up some pictures onto the internets.</p>
